# Python Process Description

## Importing Libraries/Data
1. Imported plotly, matplot, pandas, numpy, sklearn, statsmodels.api
2. Imported datasets by imbedding GitHub URLs

## Scatterplots
1. Used matplot and plotly to create scatter plots
2. The cleaned datasets for each individual metric were used to create these plots
3. After completing this write-up, the colors of the graphs were changed to help differentiate them from each other

## Multiple Linear Regression
1. Removed any rows containing NaN values from the already merged datasets. This was only around 2-3 rows for each dataset
2. Assigned the independent and dependent variables to X and Y, respectively
3. Used a regression program to complete a regression analysis for both datasets
